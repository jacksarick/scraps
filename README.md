# Scraps ðŸ“Œ
A place to collect scraps of writing

*After using it for a while, I've decided to revisit this project*

I'm using a lot of the same code I wrote for [Beachball](https://github.com/jacksarick/beachball). Documentation is one of things on my TODO list, and some of that will be porting it over from Beachball. If you're curious as to how any of it works, I try to leave gratuitous comments


## Setup

Setup is dead simple.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacksarick/scraps.git; # clone the repo
cd scraps; # go to the folder
npm install; # build the server
npm start # start the server
```

## Maintenance and Usage
I'll be doing a little more work on this project, but then I'll leave it alone. If you find a bug, or start using it, give me a shout. Always a cool time when my code finds itself out in the world.
