# Scraps ðŸ“Œ
A place to collect scraps of writing

*After using it for a while, I've decided to revisit this project*

I'm using a lot of the same code I wrote for [Beachball](https://github.com/jacksarick/beachball). As such, the documentation is slim to none on this project, so as not to be redundant. Check beachball for any amount of detail. There ARE differences in the code between the two projects, but nothing drastic. Unless you actually want to spin up your own instance, just go over to Beachball. It really is a better project.


## Setup

Setup is dead simple.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacksarick/scraps.git; # clone the repo
cd scraps; # go to the folder
npm install; # build the server
npm start # start the server
```

## Maintenance and Usage
I'll be doing a little more work on this project, but then I'll leave it alone. If you find a bug, or start using it, give me a shout. Always a cool time when my code finds itself out in the world.
